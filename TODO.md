- load and play a three.js scene from the editor
  - non obvious
  - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/editor/js/libs/app.js
  - the camera is handled in the app.js

- do videoGrabbing css working
  - for that i need the canvas
  - thus i can keep the video behind
- make the resolution of the camera tunable
- make it work with a predefined video
  - do that in threex.videoGrabbing
- DONE make the scaleDown of the marker recognition tunable
- DONE make it work with an image
  - thus it is easier to debug
  - no need for camera
  - implement that in the videoGrabbing
